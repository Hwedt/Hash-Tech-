# Hash-Tech-
Created for the Pragyan Hackathon
- by Harshil Gupta, Janesh Balchandani and Rishi Sharma 
Attending our first hackathon with time restrictions, we thought the best way to recieve alerts would be through an API telgram app. 
After taking the inputs from the user about the chat id and city they wanted, 
we send aqi levels to the telegram chat every 15 minutes with the relevant range of warnings.
