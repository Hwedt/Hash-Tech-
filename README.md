You need to provide your city name as well as your telegram chat id
You can access your chat id from the following link: https://api.telegram.org/bot1519053190:AAFG5pVxFcvrwmA9sp0rUuRXYf4aJdWvAKk/getUpdates
We thought the best way to recieve alerts would be through a telegram bot. 
After taking the inputs from the user about the chat id and city they wanted, 
we send aqi levels to the telegram chat every 15 minutes with the relevant range of warnings.
